This is an unofficial satyrographos package list website. [SATySFi](https://github.com/gfngfn/SATySFi) is a typesetting system and [Satyrographos](https://github.com/na4zagin3/satyrographos) is its package manager.

Package informations are updated by GitHub Actions every hour. They are fetched from [satyrographos-repo](https://github.com/na4zagin3/satyrographos-repo).

Suggestions for improvement are welcome. Please send issues or pull-requests casually.
